1) Revenue engine requirements (how you get “top CPM/RPM” from AdSense)
A. You optimize for Page RPM, not just traffic

AdSense defines Page RPM as:
(estimated earnings ÷ pageviews) × 1000.
So your job is to raise earnings per session by improving:

1) Viewability (biggest RPM lever on news sites)
Google explicitly recommends optimizing ad placement/design to improve viewability.
Practical requirements:

At least one strong above-the-fold slot that loads fast

Longer article templates (so you can place 2–4 quality slots without cramming)

Sticky footer/banner (mobile) without blocking content

2) Policy-safe layouts (protect your account + keep advertisers bidding)
Follow AdSense ad placement policies (avoid accidental clicks, misleading headings, content that mimics ads, etc.).

3) Fast ads (don’t let ads kill your Core Web Vitals)
Google’s publisher guidance emphasizes loading ads efficiently to avoid hurting page speed and UX.
And Google has shown publishers can connect Core Web Vitals field data with AdSense/Ad Manager performance to understand revenue impact.

4) Better advertisers → better bids
AdSense pays more when your site attracts higher-value campaigns. Requirements:

Clear topic/category taxonomy (Miami politics, real estate, business, law, luxury, etc.)

Clean brand safety signals: no clickbait, no scraped content, no “thin” pages

2) Search dominance requirements (Google SEO that actually ranks)
A. Meet Google’s baseline + avoid penalties

Start with Search Essentials (technical + content expectations).
And take spam policies seriously—especially anything that looks like scaled low-quality publishing.

B. News SEO must be “crawler-obvious”

Your article pages must make it effortless for Google to understand:

One canonical URL per story

A visible headline (H1), author byline, publish date, and updated date (when applicable)

Clean internal linking: section pages → story clusters → evergreen explainers

C. Structured data is non-negotiable

Google recommends Article structured data for news/blog pages to help with title/image/date understanding and eligibility across surfaces like Google News.
Also follow Google’s structured data policies (markup must reflect visible content, be accurate, etc.).

Date accuracy matters for news: show user-visible dates and keep structured data consistent—Google explicitly warns against incorrect/future dates and recommends datePublished/dateModified.

3) Google News integration requirements (per article + site-wide)
A. Use Publisher Center correctly

Publisher Center is where publishers submit/manage content for Google News.

B. Create a Google News sitemap

Google’s official guidance:

Only include articles from the last 2 days

Update frequently as you publish

Use proper <news:publication_date> and other required tags
Publisher Center also documents News sitemap usage.

C. Article template requirements for Google News

Per Google’s Publisher Center best practices:

Correct datePublished/dateModified + timezone

If using a News sitemap, include <publication_date> per URL

4) Yahoo distribution requirements (what’s realistic)

Unlike Google News (mostly crawl + Publisher Center), Yahoo distribution is partnership-based:

Option A: Publish directly to Yahoo via Yahoo for Creators

Yahoo launched “Yahoo for Creators,” a publishing platform for vetted creators to publish and monetize on Yahoo’s network.

Option B: Become a Yahoo content partner

Yahoo’s official help doc says to complete their “Content Opportunities” form to form a content partnership (US).

Requirement: Don’t think “toggle a setting per article.” Think feed + partnership + editorial quality.

5) “Blazing fast” requirements (Core Web Vitals targets you must hit)

If you want top SEO + high ad revenue, you need “Good” CWV in the real world:

LCP ≤ 2.5s

INP < 200ms

CLS ≤ 0.1

For your Next.js + WordPress GraphQL stack, that means:

Server-side caching (HTML + data) + CDN edge caching

Aggressive image optimization (next/image, proper sizes, modern formats)

Minimal third-party scripts (every widget is a CWV tax)

Load ads intelligently (lazy-load below fold; keep the first view fast)

6) Social share requirements (so every article can spread)

Your share buttons are the easy part—the real requirement is share-ready metadata:

Open Graph: title, description, image, URL

X/Twitter card tags

Canonical URL

Clean, stable featured image (consistent aspect ratio)

UTM strategy for tracking (optional but powerful)

Then implement share buttons for: X, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Email, Copy Link.

7) The “money” ops requirements (the stuff most blogs skip)

To be “best in the world,” you need newsroom-grade operations:

Editorial trust pages: About, Contact, Editorial Policy, Corrections Policy, Privacy Policy

Author pages with bios and expertise

Clear separation of news vs sponsored

A repeatable system:

Daily publishing cadence

Evergreen explainers that internal-link from breaking news

Email newsletter + push notifications + social distribution

Your priority checklist (build in this order)

Core Web Vitals “Good” on mobile article pages

Article structured data + correct dates

Google News sitemap + Publisher Center setup

AdSense: policy-safe placements + viewability improvements

Share-ready OG/Twitter metadata + share buttons

Yahoo: apply to Creators or content partnership
